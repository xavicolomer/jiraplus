heJIRA (Beta)
===================================================

IMPORTANT NOTE:
-----------------
hejira. Any flight or journey to a more desirable or congenial place.
        

Having multiple people working on the same project is great because you always reach greater goals. On the other hand different people means different criteria and that translates to non consistent documentation, tickets, etc. Because people do not tend to follow the guidelines...

This extension allows you to add templates and validations to some forms before submit, to make sure there's only one criteria :)

For now there are not much actions, but I probably will add more soon.


What is this plugin?
------------------------
This plugin is a set of tools to improve developers and testers workflow using JIRA.

Right now allows you to create validation and prefill forms for defect and sub-tasks.


How can I install?
-----------------
You only have to go to the Chrome store and install the extension.


How does it work
-----------------
Add event listeners to the environment and reacts according to the user 
decisions.
